# The Bind Method

- You Can "Pema-bind a function to a context": 
    - See the Bind Method.js file

- Binding Arguments 
    - You can also bind arguments to functions. 
        - That will bake them into the function. 

- Bind with Event Listeners
    - Useful when you do not directly call functions ourselfs but let JS call them for us
        - Useful for eventListeners, timers, callback functions using map, filter async etc.
