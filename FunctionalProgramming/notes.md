# Functional Programming

- Functional Programming
    - A new way of thinking about code and structuring/organizing our code
    - The Process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. 
    - Functional Programming is often declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. 

- FP Idioms we have seen so far: 
    - Functional Programming methods you've met and should know: 
        - map, filter, some/every, find/findIndex

- Esssential Concepts to cover: 
    - Higher Order Functions, first class functions 
    - pure functions
    - immutability
    - closure
    - partial application / currying
    - function composition

- What FP Avoids
    - looping
    - mutation and shared state
    - variable declaration

- Essentially its a style of how we want to code!

- Imperative Programming
    - All about describing how a program operates using statements and code to manipulate a program's state
    - changes the variable

- Functional Programing 
    - Essentially using functions to program, using code to solve stuff without mutating existing variables
    - does not change a variable
    - basically working with data, but not changing the original data
    - more about the relationship between the input / output
    - using functions to do the programing for us rather than build everything from scratch

- First Class Functions
    - JS doesn't care how are functions are ran or stored
    - Basically using functions as arguments or parameters
    - JS treats functions as any other variable
