# Web Sockets API

- Websocket API
        - Enables real time communication between a client and a server
        - We also have access to other Web APIs like WebRTC  API, which provides real-time audio, video, and data communication
        - Super useful for live information data, Crypto, Stocks, Online Gaming, Chat Apps etc. 
        - A bi-directional tunnel of communication
            - Like a phone call that doesn't hang up
        - We can use a library for this called Express Websockets, or make it from scratch with new WebSocket(webSocketURL)
        Then it has a few events .onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose then a function
