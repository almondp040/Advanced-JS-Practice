    - Gives us performance timing data for pages, functions etc. 
    - Typically used to report performance data back to the devs. 
    - uses performance.mark and performance.measure to measure the results of our performance marks
    
- Measuring Resource Load Times with Performance API
    - using performance.getEntries we can get access to the performance data array
    - getEntries looks at all components and grabs the performance of everything! 

- Web Audio API
    - Allows for the processing and synthesizing of autio in web applications
    - By using AudioContext() we can make use of the Audio Context class and its methods!
    - Alot of people also use a Library as well for this

- Web Audio Use Cases:
    - Instead of loading a audio file we can make one from scratch so that it's faster and easier for the browser, just not that easy to do!
