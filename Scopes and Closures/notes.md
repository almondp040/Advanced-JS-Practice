# Scopes and Closures

- Recaping Var & Scope: 
    - Nothing with var is scoped to a code block and variables are scoped to their functions! 
    - if made outside of a function it can be used globally

- Recaping Let, Const and Scope
    - using Var can mess up the variables tied to the window object
    - let allows us to have a redefinable variable 
    - const allows us to have a constant variable
    - just use let and const if possible, this will not conflict with the variables tied to the window object/items. 
        - Same with const. 
    - These are blocked scoped so let and const will be scoped to these blocks
