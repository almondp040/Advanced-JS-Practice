# Notifications API

- Notifications API 
    - Enables web pages to display notifications to users
    - See app.js file

- Notification Events
    - We can use notifications with addEventListener as well! 
    - Check out the Notification Functions we can use with it via MDN or the console via prototype
    - Can use 'click', and 'close' in the eventListener to set up logic for when the notification is open vs when it was closed

- Notifications With Icons and Data
    - With notifications options we can adjust what we specifically want in our notification. 
    - We can also attach data to it
