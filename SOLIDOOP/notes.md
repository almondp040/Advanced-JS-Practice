# Solid OOP Principles

- How to structure Object Orientated Code
    - Doesnt have to be followed but recommended

- Single Responsibility Principle
    - A class should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should only have 1 job or responsibility
    - KEEP CLASSES DOING 1 THING AND SIMPLE!!


- Open/Closed Principle
    - Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that the behavior of a module can be extended without modifying its source code. 
    - We should be able to extend functionality without modifying the original class

- Liskov Substitution Principle
    - Objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.
